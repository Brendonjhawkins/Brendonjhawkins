### STAR  ⭐⻤

An experienced designer who is innately inquisitive. Ever growing interests have mapped a career starting in marketing and customer-centered design, which has since transitioned to creating robust full stack web applications. Currently open to opportunities which allow me to flex my design history & clean and scalable code capabilities; such as Product Manager and UX/UI Engineer.
